decades global energy consumption growth dominated oil natural gas coal grew decade oil years gas years comparisons energy sources stark years protocol signed growth primary energy consumption coal times larger wind solar nuclear energy incredible growth coal consumption means global energy carbon intensive protocol signed growth coal dominated country china growth global coal consumption years came china china consumes half world’s thing china produces consumes half production major materials dominated china remarkable china’s dominance cement making china laying concrete years century probably astounding literally unbelievable fact demonstrating rapid growth materials comes massive energy carbon emissions footprint cement steel making china require energy emit carbon dioxide major economies japan rapid expansion coal china saw overtake world’s biggest emitter carbon dioxide late importantly union terms carbon dioxide emissions china emits tonnes carbon dioxide given china’s carbon dioxide emissions continuing rise union falls highly certain china’s carbon dioxide emissions union’s end china level terms carbon dioxide emissions lower terms energy consumption clear comparing china’s coal consumption years ago annual coal consumption tonnes united kingdom 2.9 tonnes china china long way simply catch century energy consumption japan roughly times higher china north times higher united kingdom’s energy consumption closer china highlights clear problem lot energy consumption outsourced china sit typing things computer clothes similarly large china’s energy consumption make stuff countries shown work glen peters china’s energy consumption clearly times lower developed country lot energy consumed china used produce stuff western china’s energy consumption appears certain increase significantly illustrated comparing china’s travel patterns united kingdom considering china’s relatively low levels domestic electricity consumption total passenger forms transport united kingdom billion 13,000 contrast china total 3,100 billion passenger 2,400 people travel times china disparity likely persist official statistics indicate travel china roughly doubled decade travel developed countries appears travel china reflected oil consumption average person china consumes times oil times lower united kingdom lowest rates consumption developed countries naturally statistics demonstrate low rates consumption china excessive rates consumption north consume times energy little terms quality life typical western economies electricity consumed people’s homes china china make prone watch result stark differences electricity average person china average consumes times electricity home average person china average person consumes times reflects extent china’s economic model based production consumption china’s transition higher personal consumption levels inevitably marked increase electricity differences likely persist long energy consumption western economies flat decades fact higher today united kingdom energy consumption china risen decade inevitably continue rise couple decades probably fundamental questions remain china consume energy follow excessive model china’s energy consumption continue dominated coal future planet rest global energy consumption statistics taken statistical review world travel domestic electricity consumption

population densities major cities china went route china’s big cities generally people square range actually lot denser big cities range la closer obviously density isn’t given rate china good marker expect path charts easy eye clean point density degree autos high density better fit fewer service stations single story structures highly undesirable high density high density suggests shorter trips range anxiety issue today’s shorter range cars good metering friendly load supporting reduced including density largest cities result cheap gasoline cultural leanings innate frugality petroleum resources infrastructure built density cities highway probably hew model relative dearth oil regards coal air quality argument china pretty compelling government allegedly ones paint allow coal caused pollution continue answer going gas you’d expect mention shale you’d right don’t think dismiss ability country built 10,000 highway years bought line ahead schedule budget there’s plenty gas notably recent deal gas stranded used china good coal switching similarly there’s lot actual potential available china rid coal unlikely rid dirtiest china concerned coal imports energy security regards industry emissions industry printing change things general good example textile industry alarmed china size cars figured companies pioneers people driving golfs wrong doesn’t car size china built

jaguar land rover ford issue cultural cars opposed houses seen good mode peoples taste wealth people wealth power want differentiate ordinary man street inherent societies china especially reflected car leads remains probably mean resources thrown transport possibly extreme cities china probably develop good bad john today china close dialog probably talked business usual mere efficiency measures wind turbines solar panels fluff designed world dominated fossil fuels box developing reasonable way advanced nuclear path leads destruction annual coal consumption tonnes united kingdom 2.9 tonnes china china long way simply catch century peak coal 1913… used coal heating lighting transportation abysmal efficiencies compared today china improving efficiencies expanding nuclear hydro included natural gas oil account growing energy use china reaching tons capita coal consumption continue better comparison china capita coal consumption peaked 2007-2008 3.5 tons capita coal china energy consumed capita highest world china benefit gas building nuclear fleet greater increase hydro wind china’s coal plants new efficiencies talk coal mainly talking electricity generation capita consumption roughly right now… short capita consumption countries 3-4 times higher capita china definitely consume lot energy future come coal lot depends china pursues growth industries steel glass cement chemicals account big energy consumption turn depend housing boom china china’s cities rebuilt demand fall china’s coal consumption billion metric ton world’s coal emissions billion metric ton world built lot dirty coal plants past years minimal air pollution control systems average efficiency lbs enters typical efficiencies 99.5 greater lbs enters atmosphere means ton china burns times dirtier reason china’s air polluted similarly regarding reducing bad actors china etc. clean acts point clean energy community want believe china replace coal fleets energy sources economical solution air pollution problems probably add existing coal plants reduction particulate emissions wonders air quality hope new builds coal acceptable pollution controls costs cleaner options what’s point comparing emissions tons efficiencies creates times capita china simply labeling making prerequisite action undertaken privileged nation earth coincidentally responsible current levels atmospheric carbon sounds massive abdication responsibility adding high efficiency fabric filter systems catch particulates greater 0.5 micron adding scrubbing systems china regarding enormous coal consumption unique world unique damage people started process clean air act rulers finally recognized admitted major problem passing clean air act modeled acts regarding coal plants effective end means years bad actors want spend money clean mess regarding coal burning knew rest world knew upcoming problem pollution capita absurd regarding aspect abdication words used people make poor issues specifically addressing regarding reducing bad actors china etc. clean acts failure add scrubbing systems global ironically despite fact it’s unhealthful people living aerosol emissions reflect sunlight space resulting net cooling effect want government task exposing people bad air point it’s probably similar living large cities exposed early 20th century flue gas available took years make mandatory course countries simply making power availability priority similar phase relates issues capita evaluation relevant capita income times china’s standard better position afford necessary expense cleaning regarding reducing bad actors china etc. clean acts statement doesn’t make action global warming prerequisite mean bob china’s soot snow ice surfaces china’s burning ton coal equivalent burning etc. pollution conscious late resulted clean air act lead followed quickly china built dirty coal plants years years 20th burn coal burns lot coal dirty manner special responsibility regarding aspect china continue spending rest world make difference regarding maybe world set environmental defense fund help developing nations clean act spending billion addition current spending numbers worldwide
