combustion engine oil reduce friction electromagnetic fan clutch optimized cooling engine new axle ratio configuration low tires vi models reduced friction losses transmission manual gearshift engine bar injection pressure new injectors engine increase maximum injection pressure bar enhanced noise insulation ensures translate higher noise level outside inside canter output torque data remain unchanged following development versions engine internal designation available previously optional function engine included standard models driving short distances technology reduce fuel consumption longer axle ratios reduce fuel consumption elasticity relatively compact engine allowed engineers reconfigure axle ratios versions longer ratio quiet economical compromising driving dynamics maximum performance frequently carrying load towing trailer demanding models available shorter axle ratio optimized emission control canter available choice different emission control systems following introduction new vi emissions standards systems modified adapted meet new requirements canter models permissible 6.0 comply emissions standard exhaust gases cleaned combination exhaust gas
