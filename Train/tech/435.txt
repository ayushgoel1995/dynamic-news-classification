gas alcohols sounds good convert abundant natural gas liquids real boon flex fuel cars big establish real market large amounts probably work better sequestering make longer chain alcohols ethanol preferably posted march market come viable technologies large gas fields small ones close markets example recently reported small project day gas hope alcohol ester production leads technology viable small scale posted march acid compound formula chemistry catalysts way use waste heat power plants natural gas gasoline efficiently throw away lot heat power plants use make fuel posted march interested years years buy synthetic fuel gas dodge neon prefer buy instead car flex fuel thing sure patents bought shelfs protect conventional high paying petrol business time read novel breakthrough method produce synthetic fuels happen thing method way efficient cheaper dark subsidized studies patents sold instead useful production pay high dollar mud petrol cheap dodge infinite ways propel car cheap website unable completely make happen simplest way stop cartel petrol gasoline gasoline cents gallon posted march video make longer chain alcohols carbon added great source posted march use directly market oh video posted march surely need carbon oxygen posted march pm inserting oxygen atom carbon atom hydrogen atom make alcohol need carbon oxygen note thallium extremely toxic acid extremely corrosive process likely scalable posted march pm lab findings knew worth commercial application valuable people lab work methane methanol synthetic gasoline total oil company method skips methanol goes methane gasoline using methane efficiency gasoline efficient using waste heat power plants natural gas gasoline close worse tar sands high octane gasoline posted march pm upscale new technology utilize solvent extraction hydrocarbons coal separate lower coke sulfates huge refinery capacity burn clean coal plenty gasoline straightforward efficient lower grade modern oil refineries burn oil coke basic energy actually greater energy efficiency advertised posted march pm refineries carbon fuel cell comes cell combine hydrogen electricity generated fuel cell make gasoline good
