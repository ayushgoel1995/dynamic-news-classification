 congested roads headache modern cities solutions city banish completely traffic jams bane lives it’s daily bottleneck commute work endless delays motorways start holidays think journey bad spare thought drivers evening traffic jams rush hour added cumulative queue according city’s traffic management frustrating major contributor air pollution that’s bad climate everybody’s health according researchers center risk analysis congestion largest urban areas united states caused 2,200 premature deaths added public health economic cost lost hours work leisure delayed shipments drivers cities united states sit hours traffic jams wasting time fuel isn’t new problem course car boom city planners seemingly obvious solution build wider roads didn’t work roads created cars attracted example study new additional traffic increase highway capacity years what’s solution traffic planners betting lanes opportunities improved public transport ease congestion cities resorted subtle methods banning cars driving certain days alternating cars plates end uneven vs understanding causes congestion place step bottlenecks road sheer volume cars obvious sources traffic jams appear seemingly spontaneously maybe caused single driver suddenly switching lanes results cars braking suddenly ripple effect rapidly snarling study institute technology blamed combination aggressive drivers fast close car timid drivers leave large gaps traffic kinds force drivers brake resulting ripples bringing traffic used analogies try model traffic flows fluid gas flow movement birds skiers university analogies help scientists gain understanding obvious traffic flows flow traffic drivers looking place park cities trying manage flow systems use sensors determine particular spot street car park occupied vacant smart sensors guides drivers quickly efficiently vacant parking spots hope ease congestion trial sensors started far cities currently serviced xerox years ago trialled smart parking providers using developed professor king’s college company nearly 20,000 smart parking spaces far largest smart parking smart city deployment number traffic jams gone people informed parking narrow streets ending curse congested city streets need radical rethink solutions begin roads cars cars communicate real time ripples smoothed car monitor motion vehicle vehicles ahead prepare going happen
